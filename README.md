# Overview
Simple demo Android app that uses Huawei's most common services from HMS core like Account-Kit and In-App-Purchases. In this demo app the user can open the app and sign in with Huawei ID, then after the sign in success he moves to the next screen to play a video but when he clicks on play button, he must be pay first to stream the video. So, this demo mainly works on Huawei authentication,
and In-App-Purchases payment SDK as well.

## HMS SDKs
- Account-Kit
- In-App-Purchases

## Work-flow
In this project I have been using a simple git work-flow with feature branching model.
Also, you can find the history of the development process and each feature implementation in a seprate branch and explore it as well.
